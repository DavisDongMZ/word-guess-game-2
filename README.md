# word-guess-game-2
## This is the second version of wordle game, this is a group project and it's been implemented by group size of 2 @Zehao Fan.
Right now we have finished the first part of wordle game, which use REACT as frontend frameword and nodejs as backend server, connected by fetch api.
### To start the wordle game
First if you haven't learn REACT before, I would strongly recommend you know how to start a REACT project.
You can create REACT project by
```
npx create-react-app "name"
```
Remember here is a demo of our game, you can create your own project and use our idea to implement your game. :)
Before you start the front end, please run
```
npm install/ npm start
```
### Backend service
The backend is implemented by nodejs, you can also change the end point or use other api(like RESTful) if you want.
Please run
```
npm install / nodejs ...
```
### Demo
Game demo should be the same as word guess game 1 in my repo, if you want to check you can visit that.
